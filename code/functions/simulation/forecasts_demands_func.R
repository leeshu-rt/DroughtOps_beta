#******************************************************************
# A function that provides the necessary demand forecasts
# (Right now its just reading the input demand time series)
#   - it's being called by simulation_func, 
#   - which is called by sim_main_func and sim_add_days_func
#   - which is called by server.R
#******************************************************************
# Inputs
#******************************************************************
# date_sim - the current date in the simulation
# demands.daily.df - a df containing the demand time series, with
#   d_pot_total - total wma potomac demands
#   ? which does simulation need??? above or d_total - total wma demands
#   d_fw_e - Fairfax Water eastern service area demand (no LW)
#   d_fw_w - Fairfax Water western service area demand (no LW)
#   d_fw_c - Fairfax Water central service area demand (no LW)
#   d_lw - Loudoun Water total demand (incl. purchase from FW)
#   d_wa - Washington Aqueduct demand
#   d_wssc - WSSC demand
#******************************************************************
# Output
#******************************************************************
# A vector of 15 demands, beginning with today's 
#   and ending 14 days hence.
# These are actual data, serving as placeholder values for forecasts.
