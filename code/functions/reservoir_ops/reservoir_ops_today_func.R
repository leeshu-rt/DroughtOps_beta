#******************************************************************
# date_sim = current date in the simulation
# res = reservoir name (sen, jrr, pat, or occ) 
#  (?to simulate sav: add 20% to jrr cap and combine sav & jrr inflows?)
# res.ts.df = reservoir time series dataframe
# withdr_req = withdrawal request (= 0 for sen & jrr)
# ws_rel_req = release request for water supply purposes
#     (release over dam to stream below)
# prioritization of flowby vs water supply is really a policy decision!
# prioritization: in logic below, 1st priority is flowby = res@flowby
#                 2nd priority is withdr_req
#                 3rd priority is ws_rel_req
#   all of WMA reservoirs except Savage have ws withdr OR rel, NOT both
#   in case of Savage, I THINK Westernport withdr would have priority
#       over a release, but I THINK min flowby would have 1st priority?
#

#        (includes total release, for whatever purposes, incl. spill)
#    w_req - water supply withdrawal request (from intake)
#    ws_rel_req - water supply release request
